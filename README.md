# Gasoline_prices_in_Poland_May_2022
#This repo contains analysis of gasoline prices in Poland from years 2005 - 2022.

## 1) Web Scrapping based on data from LOTOS group
Using LOTOS data I extracted fuel prices: Pb95, Pb98 and ON

## 2) Data cleaning and preparing for further changes
I cleaned the data from unnecessary signs and changed data type. Used dates as an indexes.

## 3) Joining and filling data
Using 3 existing file I prepared a final version of datafile using merge method and converted prices

## 4) Visualization
Using Seaborn and Matplotlib I prepared a Time Series lineplots

## 5) Statistics
I decided to prepare statistical backgroud using mean, max and average each of selected fuel types. ON one had the highest price, the same with mean. The lowest price was seen with Pb95

## 6) TO DO - Machine learning
Project will be expanded in future with prediction of prices for next years
